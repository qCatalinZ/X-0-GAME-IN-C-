# X-0-GAME-IN-CPP-

The first .cpp file ("1.x&0 w 012345678") is x&0 where you have to type a number from 0 to 8 ("0" represents the first square on the table, "1" the second, and and so on and so forth) and press "enter" to confirm your square

The second .cpp file ("2.x&0 w 012345678") is x&0 where you can move around on the table by pressing W (W means moving up with 1 square), S (moving down), A (left) or D (right) and press "enter" to confirm your square. This version of the game is not finished because you can't see the square you want to claim, by that I mean that the position of the game starts from smallest number from the vector (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) that is not claimed by someone. There is no visual representations if you are on the first square on the first line or on the middle square on the last line before you claim it.
